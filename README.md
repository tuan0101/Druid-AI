# Druid-AI
In this game, I created a patrol system that AI bots is getting smarter through each difficulty level to chase and attack the player. If there is no player in range, the AI bots will be destroying all the alive plants around. If the player is killed by the AI bots or cannot heal 10 plants until all of them are dead, the game is over.
